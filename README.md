# day-of-air-generator
A client-side application for TV producers that generates on-air screen graphics using HTML5 Canvas.

## Issues
1. ~~Correct L3_Gradient to match our Photoshop template~~
2. ~~Fix transparent edges on FS_Portrait~~
3. ~~Use "TeX Gyre Heros" as back-up font and test on Windows machine~~
4. Use arrows and use inline-input with text. Ex. "Your image is [50%] from the top of canvas."
5. Add minimum resolution for images according to canvas or container
6. Add FS_Centered template with no-crop, while waiting for #7.
7. Allow scaling of images
