# day-of-air-generator
A client-side application for TV producers that generates on-air screen graphics using HTML5 Canvas.

## Issues
1. ~~Correct L3_Gradient to match our Photoshop template~~
2. ~~Fix transparent edges on FS_Portrait~~
3. ~~Use "TeX Gyre Heros" as back-up font and test on Windows machine~~
4. ~~Use arrows and use inline-input with text. Ex. "Your image is [50%] from the top of canvas."~~
5. Add YouTube logo to social icons.
6. Fix social icons alignment when using "Tex Gyre Heros"
7. Make "On the Phone" text font-weight 800 when using "Helvetica"
8. Add minimum resolution for images according to canvas or container
9. Remove portrait vs landscape restriction across all templates
10. Add FS_Centered template with no-crop, while waiting for #7
11. Allow scaling of images
12. Improve readFile() by getting image properties onload, if possible, rather than using setTimeout()
