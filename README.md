A client-side application for TV producers that generates on-air screen graphics using HTML5 Canvas.

## Issues
1. ~~Correct L3_Gradient to match our Photoshop template~~
2. ~~Fix transparent edges on FS_Portrait~~
3. ~~Use "TeX Gyre Heros" as back-up font and test on Windows machine~~
4. ~~Use arrows and use inline-input with text. Ex. "Your image is [50%] from the top of canvas."~~
5. ~~Add YouTube logo to social icons.~~
6. ~~Fix social icons alignment when using "Tex Gyre Heros"~~
7. ~~Make "On the Phone" text font-weight 800 when using "Helvetica"~~
8. ~~Add FS_No-Crop template, while waiting for scaling~~
9. Check compatibility on modern browsers and add notes to README
10. ~~Check if addText() has alignment fix for social icons when using "Tex Gyre Heros"~~
11. Routine clean-up of GeneratorJS
12. Improve readFile() by getting image properties onload. If not, provide warning for images larger than a certain size (ex. 4000 x 4000).
13. Allow scaling of images
14. Remove portrait vs landscape restriction across templates
15. Add minimum resolution for images according to canvas or container
16. ~~Match social icons regardless of capitalization~~
